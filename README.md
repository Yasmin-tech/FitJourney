## Description

FitJourney is a powerful fitness-tracking API designed to help users manage their workouts, monitor their progress, and efficiently achieve their fitness goals. Offering a comprehensive set of features for individuals of all fitness levels, from beginners to advanced athletes. 
The application relies on the **FitJourney APP API** to facilitate seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components. Users can easily manage their workout plans, detailing each day with predefined exercises targeting specific muscle groups. They also have the option to create their own exercises, complete with images or videos for proper execution. Additionally, users can log their daily exercise sessions, allowing them to track their progress and stay on course to achieve their fitness objectives.


## Purpose
The primary goal of the FitJourney APP API is to offer developers a powerful and versatile set of tools for creating their own fitness planning and tracking applications. By utilizing this API, developers can design apps that empower users to plan workout sessions, track exercises, monitor their progress, and access tailored fitness plans. The API is engineered for reliability and efficiency, ensuring smooth integration and interaction with various front-end applications.


## Goals

-   **User Management**: Enable users to create accounts, log in, upload a profile picture for personalization, and manage their profiles securely.

-   **Personalized Workout Plans**: Assist users in managing their workout plans by helping them define their goals, current weight, target weight, the duration of the plan in weeks, and the number of days they plan to exercise each week. Then, create a detailed daily plan that includes exercises. Users can either select predefined exercises from the system based on the target muscle groups or create their own custom exercises.

-   **Custom Exercises**: Users should be able to create their own exercise sets, including a description of each exercise and its instructions. They can categorize the exercises (e.g., Cardio, Strength), specify the muscle groups targeted, list any necessary equipment, and include images or videos to aid in performing the exercises correctly.

-   **Progress Monitoring**: Allow users to log their daily exercise sessions to help them track progress and achieve their fitness goals. Users can enter all relevant details of each exercise, including the number of sets and reps completed, the duration of rest between sets, the weight lifted in kilograms for strength training exercises, as well as the location and difficulty of the workout. This information will assist them in receiving feedback for their next session. Additionally, a notes section will be provided for users to record any observations or thoughts efficiently.

-   **Exercise Tracking**: Creating daily logs will enable users to see and track their progress and adjust their plans accordingly.


## Features

- ‚úîÔ∏è  **Secure Authentication**: User authentication and authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure a secure process.


- ‚úîÔ∏è  **RESTful Endpoints**: A comprehensive set of RESTful endpoints allows for the execution of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users, workouts, exercises, and other entities.


- **Data Validation**: Robust mechanisms for data validation are in place to ensure data integrity and consistency.


- ‚úîÔ∏è  **Role-Based Access Control**: The system includes a main admin user who has access to all API endpoints and is responsible for granting access to other developers. Admins can create developer roles and assign them to engineers involved in the project. Certain endpoints are restricted to users with Admin or Developer roles.

- ‚úîÔ∏è  **Predefined Exercises**: The API comes with over 2,000 predefined exercises, which can only be accessed by admins or developers. The dataset used to populate the exercises table is found in the `exercises_data` directory as `megaGymDataset.csv`. This data has been cleaned and processed using the `/exercises_data/data.py` script, resulting in the final `newExercisesDataset.csv`. To populate your local database, run the `populate_exercises_table.py` script, ensuring you pass the admin JWT tokens after uncommenting the last line. Note that there are no media files for the exercises, but you can send a POST request to add images or videos.

- ‚úîÔ∏è  **Google Drive Integration**: The API utilizes Google Drive as a file storage solution for media files.

- ‚úîÔ∏è  **Error Handling**: The system provides clear and informative error messages to help users and developers quickly understand and resolve any issues.

## Tech Stack

 üõ†Ô∏è The FitJourney APP API is built using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language**:
  - üêç Python: A versatile and powerful programming language used for backend development.
  
- **Web Framework**:
  - Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used to build the API.

- **Database**:
    - üê¨ MySQL: A popular open-source relational database system for storing and managing data.

- **ORM**:
  - SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

- **Database Migration**:
  - Flask-Migrate: Handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic.

- **Authentication**:
  - Flask-JWT-Extended: Provides JSON Web Token (JWT) support for secure authentication and authorization.

- **API Documentation**:
  - Swagger: A tool for describing and visualizing RESTful APIs.

- **File Storage**:
  - Google Drive: Used for storing media files like images and videos of the exercises and users' profile pictures.
